General Introduction of Free City's vision and product

Introduction

The most powerful User Aggregation Platform supported by Free City for web 3.

With the hype of GameFi and Web 3 capturing the attention of crypto enthusiast, and NFT and GameFi providing an alternative source of income and investment, we seem to experience new heights on a seemingly daily basis, the space is experiencing an unprecedented surge in global awareness & adoption. Still, only a small fraction of the world has adopted to this new space.

This worldwide interest in the power of blockchain has created the need for business users, not just from Web 3 players, but players from the traditional space to promote proactively to attract consumers to ensure NFTs can be seen. Identifying and retaining loyal users seem to be a difficult task for both players to do so. 

Free City wishes to duplicate our success from the Web 2.0 era and play a unique role to solve this issue. With our vibrant united community, Free City through its User-generated Content Social Platform, business users can market their products via audio room events / moments more efficiently, ads-free but with the support from Free City.

The Free City Vision

FCC aims to becoming the user aggregating layer of Web 3.0. By providing strong user-generated content features and a zero-friction user onboarding process, Free City Web 3 will support multiple platforms with proof-of-interaction to achieve users integration, FCC provides the unique value proposition for Web 3 protocols, communities, and companies. FCC is the first platform that introduces the proof-of-interaction mechanism. The proof-of-interaction mechanism allows users and protocols to utilize $FCC token to achieve the common goals to benefit mutually. FCC platform essentially serves as the marketplace of native Web 3 activities and providing developers can provide users/communities to the FCC platform in exchange the FCC token as reward. 

The goal of $FCC is to ultimately transform into a DAO that is sufficiently decentralized, by doing so the $FCC community will have the most optimized point of mutual benefit.

$FCC

$FCC will power a unique and useful suite of “cross-metaverse” products beginning with First NFT Collection for $FCC holders & a Scalable Multi-Chain NFT marketplace built on the Binance Smart Chain.
Initially a place for Free City Citizens to trade, collect and showcase their NFTs, eventually, Free City Citizens along with the gaming developers will be able to contribute, curate, and ultimately guide the future of Free City and where the $FCC token may be used.
As the project expands, users who are involved and engaged with the Free City community may be rewarded in the forms of $FCC and more, NFTs designed to boost play2earn returns, and in-game NFT-backed assets from potential future partners.
This worldwide interest in the power of blockchain has created a borderless frontier built around collaboration and community involvement. Free City will play a unique role too. With our vibrant united community, Free City is now heading towards building even greater Community, DAO Governed ecosystem, a Multi Chain NFT marketplace and an eventual future Game + web3.


Tokenomics

The goal of FCC is to ultimately transform into a DAO that is sufficiently decentralized. By utilizing a decentralized model, the DAO will have the most optimized mutual benefits where each community member has their best interest in mind. The more tokens a member holds, the more they would desire to profit from the FCC platform and so will vote according to what they think is best for the platform. Therefore, this will increase the token’s value, creating a use case where all parties are incentivized appropriately.
The FCC token itself will have direct value accrual with the FCC ecosystem. All in all, the token value will grow in direct proportion to:

1.	Revenue from play-to-earn
2.	Trading 

■	cross game token swap

■	in-game and platform NFT assets

■	user generated content ecosystem

3.	Staking
4.	Liquidity mining
Products & Use case

Free City ’s NFT marketplace is designed to be a hub for an eventual ‘one-stop-shop’ and comprehensive, cross-chain solution & decentralized ecosystem that will scale across multiple metaverse, play to earn, and web 3.0 environments.

Users will be allocated an FCC ID and be rewarded for its interaction within Free City (Proof of Interaction) 
In addition to third-party partners and external integrations, Free City may develop and deploy $FCC GameFi / play to earn NFTs and game environments as well as an eventual goal of a decentralized Free City web3 environment.
With a business development around the above-mentioned use-cases and product releases, a dedicated team will lead the marketing and adoption of the marketplace.
Future developments at Free City may include development of a wide range GameFi NFTs, with $FCC being the earned currency. An eventual web3 for Free City is also in the future goals.
